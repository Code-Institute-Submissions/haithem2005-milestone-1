which allow users to contact with the band for any kind of events using a form with 4 fields (name, email , mobile, and event description).

If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address. Furthermore, the 'required' attribute is added to the 'name,' 'email,' and 'mobile' fields, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit. If all field are valid, the page will reload. 

All social links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"'. All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.

This site was tested across multiple browsers and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
